##Project Description	
Brief description of project:						<br />
CircFA is an hardware acceleration of a circular RNA aligner. Circular RNAs are a widespread type of RNA in our genome			<br />
that have been recently discovered to be correlated with many types of carcinogenesis and central neural system pathologies.	<br />
Their identfication on patients can be therefore very useful for specific diagnosis. Our solution implements the most intensive	<br />
task of the circular RNA identification on genome, which is the alignment process, on FPGA. The proposed project achieves a speedup of	
1,46x for the alignment process over similar solutions in software.
